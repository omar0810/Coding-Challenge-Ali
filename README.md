Address Book 
This application will manage an address book, user can retrieve the address book, also can Add, Edit, and delete contact.
For every contact name, the contact can have one or multiple addresses.
This application was developed using SQL server and MVC Core 6 “Although that the spec asked for version 7, but only version 6 was available to me”. This project uses Microsoft Entity Framework Code first, that means you have to run the migration to build the required database before using it. Also you have to change the connection string in appsettings.json file
To point to your SQL server
